# Introduction to Data Science

Data science enables the transformation of datasets into business assets. This is done by allowing the data scientist to use data analytics tools and methods to clean data, process it, and then create a machine-learning model to discover valuable insights and inputs. Data science uses these two variables to predict new trends and events by taking the data and identifying the problem at hand. For example, sales data can be used to predict future sales for a company using a linear regression model.

The following diagram represents how data science takes a problem and a dataset and uses machine learning to output a trained model that discovers future insights:

# Data Science Terminology
|  Keyword   |  Description  |
| --- | --- |
| Model | An algorithm that uses data to discover new patterns. |
| Parameters | Values that can change the performance of a model. |
| Target | The feature that a model predicts. |
| Overfitting | The model performs poorly on the test set. |
| Underfitting | The model performs poorly on the training and test set. |
| Linear Regression | A model that is used to predict numerical values. |
| Logistic Regression | A model that is used to predict categorical values. |
| Predictor Variables | A list of features used by the model as input. |
| Response Variable | A list of features used by the model as output |
| Numerical Variable | Features that are represented in a numerical format |
| Categorical Variable | Features that are represented in a categorical format |
| Cross-validation | Allocating a portion of our dataset as a test set. |
| Random splitting | Creating a test and a training set randomly. |
| Training Data | A big percentage of the dataset used to train the model. |
| Test Data | A small percentage of the dataset used to test the model. |
| Preprocessing | Cleaning a dataset and making sure it is ready for modeling. |
